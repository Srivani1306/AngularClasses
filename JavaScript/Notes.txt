//class-2:
InnerHTML or InnerText:
-both are used to apply the content for the HTML tags dynamically.
-InnerHTML will identify the HTML tags.
-InnerText will treat everything as a text.

//class-3
mouseevents
keyboard events
dropdown

//class-4
Arrays:
-an array is a variable which can be used to store multiple values
-In JS we don't have a datatypes so that an array can store any type of values
-generally array will store the data based on index and always index starts from "zero"
-to access the data from an attay or to assign the datainto an array we use "Index".
AR[1] = 10;       //assign
console.log(AR[1]);      //retrieve

-in javascript array is an object which contains few methods and properties 
by using them we can perform manuplations.

-Examples: push(),poop(),unshift(),slice(),splice(),reverse(),sort(),shift(


//class-5
    Json(javascript object notation):

    var x=10;
    var x=[109,'srivani',1234,5,9 ,'angular','manu']
-it is also a information storage pattern,where the complete ingoumation will be stored in key and
value pair where key and both are user defined.

var emp = {empID:101,empName:'srivani',empSalary:12345,empExp:9,empRElExp:5,empSubject:'angular'};
Limitation of javascript:
------------------------
-It is an interpreter based programming
-writing plain javascript is messy and if the application is complex we can't handle it.
-debugging is also somehow difficult.
