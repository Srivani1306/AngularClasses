Typescript:
----------
-It is a scripting language introduced by Microsoft used to generate javascript code 
once if the compilation happens
-typescript is a superset of javascript
-typescript = javascript + datatype + compiler
-browser is not able to understand the typescript code,so that we have to generate javascript by compilation progress.
-to generate it we use 'tsc <typescript_filename>.ts',where tsc stands for "typescript compiler"
-every javascript file can be  renamed as typescript also and we can use
-we should install node js and typescript from npm.
-the process of converting typescript code into javascript we call it as "transpilation".

class-6:
-------------------------------------------------------
Datatypes:
---------
-it is used to specify what type of value we can have in the variable
-a variable is a named memory location used to store the value.
-in typescript to create a variable we use "var/let/const".
-var is a function scoped,once we define var variables and reinitialize 
it will modified in all the places.
-let is a block scoped variable,'every block let variable is unique'.

-var can be defined multiple times,but let can be defined within 
the block only once.

-let syntax:  let variable:datatype = value;

-in ts,we have two types:
      -Basic types
        number
        string 
        boolean
     -complex types:
         Arrays-an aray is used to store multiple values of same type.
              syntax:
              -------
              let variable:datatype[]=[elements]  or
              let variable:array<datatype> = [value]
         Tuple:
         -----
            it is similar to array but it will store different Datatypes
            syntax:
            ------
            let variable:[datatype1,datatype2....] = [value1,value2....]
         Enum:
         -----
         syntax:
         ------
                  enum variablename{

                  }
      ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      class-7:
      ------------------
      conditional statements:
      ------------------------   if
                                 if-else 
                                 if-else ladder
                                 nested if else
                                 switch case

               Loops:
               ------
                        for in
                        for of
                        for 
                        while
                        do while


      function:
      ---------       function is a reusable block which will be call when it requires.

                    -define a function
                    -calling a function
                    -use function as a class
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   class-8:
   --------
   class:
   -----    it is a collection of prooperties and methods thosw are of similar type.

   object:-   it is a instance of class,it give physical existance for the class members
   encaposulation:-  it is the process of binding the members with the class
   abstraction: - it is the process of hiding the implementation and providing security
   polymorphism:-  one to many forms,method overloading and overriding  ,
            but overloading is not supporting in javascript.
   inheritance:-    it is the process of aquiring the properties ofone class into another class
                   -single-single parent and single child(a=>b)
                   -multi level-class chaining(a=>b=>c=>....)
                   -multiple-multiple parent and single child(a,b=c)
                   -hybrid-any of two combination(single,multiple,multi level,hybrid,heirarical)
                   -heirarical-single parent and multiple child

-constructor:  it is used to initialize data to the class members.in TS we can have only 
  one constructor.   
  -In TS if we want to access the members of the class then it ismust to use 'this'
  -in TS we have 3 types of access  modifiers like
     -private-cen be accesable with in the class
     -public-can be accesable anywhere(default)
     -protected-can be accesable only based on the derived class

     Note:
     -----  For the class we can't provide access modifiers.


     ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     class-9:
     ---------
     Note:
     -----   Method \function overloading is not possible in javascript\typescript
            -so that once if we cen give parameters then we must have to supply those many values.
            -in typescript we have a concept of optional parameters and default parameters,which 
              can be used to provide kind of overloading functionalities.
            -if it is a optional parameters,we can't give values,but if it is a default parameter we can initialize.

   Abstract class:
   ---------------   A class which contains one or more Abstract methods ,i.e Abstract class.
                 -abstract method is used to declaration,not the implementation.
                 -it is mainly used to provide runtime polymorphism.
                 -the child class will be access parent class members and provide the implementation.
                 -once we inherit a class from abstract class it is must to provide the implementation in child class.

   interface:
   ----------    it is similat to the class and it contain all abstract members
                -it is a contract between itself and derived classes,interface provide rules and derived class
                 must follow them and provide implementation.
                 -in javascript ,we don't have the concept of interface
                 -by default,interface members are public and abstract
                 -arthemetic classes and interface can't be instantiate.

   Arrow function:-
   --------------
                  -it is an anonymous function and we no need give any name for the function.
                  -in TS/JS we have two types of function:
                     -Named function
                       public Add(){}
                     -Anonymous function
                       let x = function(){}
                  -to create anonymous function we use "=>"
                  (param1,param2,param3.....) => expression

  Generics:
  ----------     - it is nothing but general datatypes.
                -at the time of declaration,we are giving generic types and while intialization will
                 be using proper types.
                -these are typesafe in nature.

  Modules:
  --------    -it is used to provide its class and members to another class
              -in Modules,we use import and export statements
              -export is used to giving privillage to access the members
              -import is used to access it.
